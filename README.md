# Google Play Plugins for Unity

## Overview

The Google Play Plugins for Unity provide C# APIs for accessing various Play
services at runtime from within the Unity Engine. These plugins also provide
various Unity Editor features for building an app that can be published on
[Google Play Console](//play.google.com/console).

## Version support

These plugins officially support Unity version 2017.4.40 or newer, though they
were written to be code compatible with Unity versions 5.6.7 or newer.

[In August 2019 Google Play started requiring that any apps published with 32
bit native libraries also provide 64 bit native
libaries.](//android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html)
An exception was made at the time enabling apps built with Unity 5.6.7 and
earlier to still be published on the Google Play Console until August 2021,
which is fast approaching.

Note: In June 2021 we will remove any plugin code that enables compilation of
Unity 2017.4.16 or earlier (including Unity 5.6.7).

## Download and import the plugins

Although it is possible to `git clone` this repository into the **Assets**
folder of your Unity project, in general it is preferable to import a released
version.

To import the plugins, follow these steps:

1.  Download the latest release from this project's
    [releases page](//github.com/google/play-unity-plugins/releases).
1.  Import the `.unitypackage` file by selecting the Unity IDE menu option
    **Assets > Import package > Custom Package** and importing all items.
